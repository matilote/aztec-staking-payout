/**
 * How the settlement transactions are shaped.
 *
 *   "safe"      – N top-level `ERC20.transfer(delegator, amount)` calls, one
 *                 per recipient. The Safe (or other smart-account UI) bundles
 *                 them via its own MultiSend, which delegatecalls so the Safe
 *                 stays `msg.sender` on every inner transfer. Tokens flow
 *                 from the Safe directly. No approval required.
 *
 *                 Required for Safes — they cannot use the `multicall` mode
 *                 (Multicall3 calls inner transfers via plain CALL, which
 *                 makes Multicall3 the `msg.sender` and the transfer
 *                 reverts with insufficient balance on Multicall3).
 *
 *   "multicall" – Two txs at most: an optional `ERC20.approve(Multicall3, total)`
 *                 (skipped when existing allowance already covers `total`),
 *                 then `Multicall3.aggregate3([ERC20.transferFrom(wallet,
 *                 delegator_i, amount_i), ...])`. Multicall3 pulls from the
 *                 distribution wallet under the approval. Fewer txs than
 *                 `safe` mode, atomic on the aggregate3 step.
 *
 *                 Intended for plain EOAs that want to settle many delegators
 *                 in a single batch transaction. Does NOT work for Safes.
