/**
 * How the settlement transactions are shaped.
 *
 *   "safe"     – N top-level `ERC20.transfer(delegator, amount)` calls, one
 *                per recipient. The Safe (or other smart-account UI) bundles
 *                them via its own MultiSend, which delegatecalls so the Safe
 *                stays `msg.sender` on every inner transfer. Tokens flow
 *                from the Safe directly. No approval required.
 *
 *                Required for Safes — they cannot use `disperse` either
 *                (works but is redundant with Safe's own MultiSend).
 *
 *   "disperse" – Two txs at most: an optional `ERC20.approve(Disperse, total)`
 *                (skipped when existing allowance already covers `total`),
 *                then `Disperse.disperseTokenSimple(token, recipients,
 *                amounts)` at `config.disperseAddress`. Disperse calls
 *                `token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipients[i], amounts[i])`
 *                for each recipient in a single tx. Fewer txs than `safe`
 *                mode, atomic in one call.
 *
 *                Safe under a race because Disperse uses `msg.sender`
 *                internally: the operator's approval to Disperse can only
 *                be consumed by the operator calling Disperse (any attacker
 *                calling Disperse would spend their own allowance, not the
 *                operator's).
 *
 *                Intended for plain EOAs. An earlier `multicall` mode used
 *                `Multicall3.aggregate3([transferFrom(operator, …), …])` and
 *                was pulled: Multicall3 lets the caller specify an
 *                arbitrary `from`, so anyone could drain the operator's
 *                Multicall3-allowance between the two txs. That has
 *                happened in the wild against this tool.
