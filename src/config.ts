/**
 * Flat schema by design: the example config is meant to be read top-to-bottom,
 * with recommended-default fields appearing first and operator-specific fields
 * (the ones you MUST set) appearing last. JSON's lack of comments + the way
 * key order tends to be preserved by editors mean flattening is the simplest
 * way to make ordering meaningful for the human reading the file.
 *
 * The example file is organised into three implicit sections:
 *
 *   1. **Tunable defaults** — `multicallAddress`, `logChunkSize`,
 *      `dustThreshold`, `runsDir`, `stakingRegistryDeployedAtBlock`.
 *      Sensible defaults, change only when you need to.
 *   2. **Network-specific** — `tokenAddress`, `stakingRegistryAddress`,
 *      `rollupAddress`. Look these up for your chain / deployment.
 *   3. **Operator-specific** — `providerId`, `distributionWalletAddress`,
 *      `rpcUrl`, `policyFile` / `policyUrl`. Set these per operator.
