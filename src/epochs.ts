/**
 * Epoch-range resolver.
 *
 * The settlement unit is the **epoch**, not the L1 block. An epoch is "ours to
 * settle" once two things are true:
 *
 *   1. The epoch has ended and all its checkpoints have been proven on L1 (rewards have been
 *      credited to the operator's coinbase in `sequencerRewards`).
 *   2. The L1 block where that proof landed is itself L1-finalized (so a reorg
 *      can never invalidate it).
 *
 * This module takes an operator-supplied `[fromEpoch, toEpoch]` and produces:
 *
 *   - `fromCheckpoint`, `toCheckpoint`  — the L2 checkpoint range that
 *     comprises those epochs (since `CheckpointProposed` carries only
 *     `checkpointNumber`, the proposal scan filters on this range).
 *   - `fromBlock`, `toBlock`            — the L1 block range bounding the
 *     period's *rewards*: `fromBlock` is the L1 block where the proof for
 *     epoch `fromEpoch - 1` landed; `toBlock` is the L1 block where the proof
 *     for epoch `toEpoch` landed. Reward counters and claims across these blocks define the accrued reward.
 *
 * Both gates are enforced here. Caller gets a fully-resolved, finalised window
 * or an error — there is no "maybe proven, maybe not" middle state.

 * `0x8711786b` on a `getEpochForCheckpoint(provenTip)` call at finality.
 *
 * The robust fix: query at the L1 block where `c` was *proposed*. At that
 * block, `pending == c` (the proposal is the one that just bumped pending), so
 * `pending - c == 0 < size` — always inside the buffer, no matter how far the
 * chain has drifted since. We find that block via a binary search over
 * historical `getTips().pendingCheckpointNumber`.
 *
 * Cost: ~26 `getTips` calls (log2 of L1 block height) plus 1
 * `getEpochForCheckpoint` per safe lookup. Heavier than the naive call but
 * the only correct option on a chain that isn't aggressively pruning.
