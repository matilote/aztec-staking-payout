A small command-line tool Aztec sequencer operators run **once a week** to pay their delegators a share of the rewards they collected — at a commission rate the operator chooses, without redeploying any contracts.

**The problem it solves.** Provider commission rates in the Aztec staking protocol are baked into each delegation's coinbase split contract and **cannot be changed**. If your operating costs rise, you have no way to adjust the effective commission on delegations that already exist.

**The workaround.** Configure your sequencers to set the L2 `coinbase` to a wallet *you* control — a Safe (Gnosis) is a good fit if you want multisig control of the payout, but the tool works with any wallet: an EOA you sign from directly, a smart-account, a cold-wallet workflow, whatever. All your provider's rewards flow there. Each week, run this tool — it figures out which of your attesters earned what, computes per-delegator amounts at your chosen commission, and gives you ready-to-sign calldata that pays everyone.

**Two transaction shapes are available** (`--output-mode`):

- `safe` (default for `--emit-calldata`): N top-level `ERC20.transfer` calls, one per delegator. The Safe wraps them in MultiSend at submission, so `msg.sender == Safe` on every inner transfer. Works for Safes, smart-account wallets, and cold-wallet EOAs signing one by one. **Required for Safes.**
- `disperse` (default for live broadcast): an optional `ERC20.approve(Disperse, total)` plus a single `Disperse.disperseTokenSimple(token, recipients, amounts)` against `disperse.app`'s battle-tested batch contract (mainnet `0xD152f549545093347A162Dce210e7293f1452150`; override via `config.disperseAddress` on other chains). Fewer txs. Safe under a mempool race because Disperse calls `transferFrom(msg.sender, …)` internally — only the operator's own call can spend the operator's allowance to Disperse.

> **Do not batch via `Multicall3.aggregate3([token.transferFrom(operator, …)])`.** An earlier version of this tool did, and it was drained in the wild. Multicall3 lets any caller pick an arbitrary `from` for its inner calls, so an attacker seeing your `approve(Multicall3, X)` in the mempool can immediately call `Multicall3.aggregate3([token.transferFrom(you, attacker, X)])` and pull the full allowance before your own `aggregate3` lands. Never approve a router that lets the caller specify `from`.

The tool **doesn't hold any funds, doesn't deploy any contracts, and doesn't send anything by default** — it produces calldata that you (or your Safe) execute.

## What you need

- The rollup address you stake against.
- An archival RPC URL (historical `eth_call` against the rollup + event scans require archive support).
- Your provider id.
- The distribution wallet that receives your sequencers' coinbase rewards. Any wallet you control — Safe / multisig / smart-account / plain EOA all work.
- A commission rate (in basis points; you can change it between runs).

All of these go in a YAML config — see [config.example.yaml](./config.example.yaml).

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd aztec-staking-payout
npm install

# 1. Copy the example config and fill in your values.
cp config.example.yaml ./config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml — set rpcUrl, providerId, distributionWalletAddress,
# tokenAddress, stakingRegistryAddress, rollupAddress, commissionBps.

# 2. (Recommended) Run a dry-run first to sanity-check the discovered
#    delegators and the derived per-checkpoint reward:
npm run settle -- --config ./config.yaml \
  --from-epoch <previous run's to-epoch + 1> --dry-run
```

(`--to-epoch` defaults to `latest-proven`, the rollup's most recent fully-proven epoch at L1 finality.)

This prints the discovered delegators, the per-attester checkpoint counts for the window, and the full settlement plan — without sending anything. Re-run it as many times as you like.

## The weekly workflow

The intended cadence is **once a week**: pick the **epoch range** covering the past week, emit the calldata, then sign it through your Safe.

The settlement unit is the epoch, not the L1 block — an epoch lands as a single proof on L1, and that proof is the moment rewards become available. Settling whole epochs means **no epoch can ever fall between two runs**: there's no `--from-block` mid-epoch that would split a proof's rewards across settlements.

### Step 1 — emit the calldata

```bash
npm run settle -- \
  --config ./config.yaml \
  --from-epoch <last week's to-epoch + 1> \
  --emit-calldata
```

`--from-epoch` is the previous run's `--to-epoch + 1` — inclusive on both ends, no gap and no overlap. `--to-epoch` defaults to `latest-proven` (the rollup's most recent fully-proven epoch at L1 finality); pin a specific number for reproducible runs. `--emit-calldata` takes an optional path argument; omitted, it writes next to the audit JSON.

The tool runs through these phases (all read-only):

1. **Resolves** `[fromEpoch, toEpoch]` to an L1 block range by reading `getTimestampForEpoch()` and binary-searching L1 block timestamps + `getProvenCheckpointNumber()`. Errors out if `toEpoch` isn't yet proven on L1, or if its proof isn't yet in an L1-finalized block (no manual override — finality is the gate).
2. Reads the rollup's `getRewardConfig()` at the toBlock for the per-checkpoint sequencer reward (`checkpointReward × sequencerBps / 10000`).
3. Resolves historical stakes to the immutable split's reward recipient. Exited validators keep rewards earned before exit. Receipt or recipient lookup failures stop the run; the staking caller is never substituted.
4. Scans `CheckpointProposed` events in the window and recovers each checkpoint's proposer attester from its `propose()` transaction's signature. **Hard-fails** if any checkpoint can't be resolved — a plan is only ever produced from 100% resolved data.
5. **Filters by coinbase.** Only checkpoints whose `header.coinbase == distributionWalletAddress` contribute to the payout. Mismatches remain in the audit trail. `--ignore-coinbase` requires `--simulate-reward` and cannot generate a real payout.
6. Adds the fixed reward and net sequencer fees for every counted checkpoint, then independently reconciles their sum to `sequencerRewards(toBlock) - sequencerRewards(fromBlock) + verified claims in (fromBlock, toBlock]`. Any discrepancy stops the run before export or payment.
7. Sums each recipient's own checkpoint earnings, then applies commission once per recipient (integer rounding down). Variable fees follow the checkpoint that earned them.
8. Emits the planned transactions in the configured output mode. Use `--output-mode safe` for Safe Transaction Builder exports.

> **Before executing the calldata**, the operator needs to claim accrued sequencer rewards from the rollup so the distribution wallet holds enough to fund the transfers: `rollup.claimSequencerRewards(distributionWallet)`. Live mode pre-flights the wallet's balance and errors clearly if it's short. Safe export also checks the wallet balance before writing the bundle.

### Step 2 — review and execute

Two files land in `./runs/`:

| File | What it is | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `epoch-<from>-<to>-<runId>.json` | **The audit record.** Epoch + checkpoint + L1 block range, finalized block, the rollup's `getRewardConfig` snapshot, per-attester checkpoint counts, the full list of attributed checkpoints with tx hashes, the commission, the per-delegator transfer breakdown, **and the encoded calldata** (`to`, `value`, `data` per tx). Self-contained — cold-wallet signers can read the transactions directly from here. | **You** (review) + delegators / outside auditors (verify) + cold-wallet workflows. |
| `epoch-<from>-<to>-<runId>.safe.json` | Same transactions in Safe Transaction Builder import format. | The Safe UI (drag-and-drop). |

The console output is the human-readable summary — it prints the discovered delegators, per-attester checkpoint counts, the full settlement plan, and a final **NEXT STEPS** block listing options for whatever signer your distribution wallet uses:

```
NEXT STEPS
==========
  Pick whichever fits your distribution wallet:

  · Safe / Gnosis multisig → app.safe.global → Apps → Transaction Builder
        import ./runs/epoch-3025-3166-<runId>.safe.json
    (must use --output-mode safe — the default for --emit-calldata)

  · Other smart-account / multisig signers usually accept the same
    Safe Transaction Builder JSON — check your tool's import options.

  · Cold-wallet / scripted signer → read the encoded {to, value, data}
    from the audit JSON's `transactions` array and broadcast directly.
    Default shape is N separate transfers (safe mode); pass
    --output-mode disperse to get an approve + Disperse.disperseTokenSimple
    pair instead.

  · EOA you control → re-run with PRIVATE_KEY set and without
    --emit-calldata to sign and broadcast in one step. Defaults to
    --output-mode disperse (2 txs: approve Disperse + one call to
    Disperse.disperseTokenSimple with all N recipients). Pass
    --output-mode safe to send N individual transfers instead.
```

### Step 3 — keep the audit record

The `epoch-*.json` file is the canonical record of what happened. Push it to a public GitHub repo after every settle (see [Publish your runs/ for public audit](#publish-your-runs-for-public-audit-strongly-recommended) below) so delegators can verify your distributions without trusting your word for it.

## Publish your runs/ for public audit (strongly recommended)

The tool's trust model assumes operators are accountable to their delegators. We strongly recommend pushing the contents of `runs/` to a **public GitHub repo** after every settlement, so that delegators and any third party can verify your distributions without trusting your word for it. The audit JSON includes the `attributedCheckpoints` array — a row per checkpoint counted, with the L1 tx hash — so a delegator can spot-check any single row by fetching that tx and recovering the proposer signature themselves.

A minimal setup:

1. Create a public repo (e.g. `your-aztec-payout-audit`) with a short README naming your operator, provider id, and distribution wallet address.
2. After each weekly settle, commit the new files under `runs/`:
   - `epoch-<from>-<to>-<runId>.json` — audit record + encoded calldata. The canonical source of truth.
   - `epoch-<from>-<to>-<runId>.safe.json` — Safe Transaction Builder import. Deterministic from the audit; committing it makes "drop into Safe and verify" trivially possible for anyone.
3. Push.

What a delegator can then do, end-to-end, *without* trusting you:

1. Open the audit JSON. The `rewardConfig` snapshot + `checkpointsProposed` give the total reward (`checkpointsProposed × sequencerRewardPerCheckpoint`), and `transfers[]` is the per-delegator breakdown.
2. Jump to `attributedCheckpoints[]`, pick any row, and look up that `txHash` on a block explorer. The `propose()` calldata's signature recovers to that row's `attester` — confirming the operator actually proposed it.
3. Sum the proposals for each delegator, apply the operator's published commission, and compare to the `transfers[]` array. Numbers must match exactly.
4. Re-run this tool with the operator's published config and the same `--from-epoch`/`--to-epoch` (pin a number, not `latest-proven`). For a fixed epoch window it's deterministic, so they should get byte-identical numbers.

This turns operator margin from "trust me bro" into a verifiable artifact. There is no reason **not** to publish.

## Checks enforced before payout

The tool **refuses to produce a plan from incomplete data**. Specifically:

- **Complete epochs.** Proofs can cover only part of an epoch. The resolver verifies that the epoch has ended, resolves its actual last checkpoint, and requires that checkpoint to be proven in finalized L1 state. It checks adjacent checkpoint epochs to reject missing or overlapping boundaries.
- **Finalization gate.** A run **only ever considers epochs that are (a) proven on the rollup AND (b) in an L1-finalized block**. The resolver caps `--to-epoch` at the latest proven epoch and refuses any window whose proof block isn't yet L1-finalized. There's no opt-out — reorg safety is the default.
- **Exact earnings and independent reconciliation.** Fixed checkpoint rewards plus net sequencer fees must equal the rollup reward-counter change plus verified claims. Fees subtract the protocol burn and capped prover payment. Fees are assigned to their original beneficiaries. A reward-configuration change inside a window, unsupported fee header, unknown claim wrapper, or accounting mismatch stops the run.
- **Coinbase integrity gate.** Of the checkpoints proposed by the operator's attesters, only those whose `header.coinbase == distributionWalletAddress` contribute to `countedCheckpoints`. Checkpoints routed elsewhere (a mid-window coinbase switch, a misconfigured sequencer, a builder/escrow address) are recorded in the audit trail with `counted: false` and dropped from the reward. This keeps the tool from promising delegators more than actually landed in the wallet. `--ignore-coinbase` requires a hypothetical `--simulate-reward` run.
- **Retry + rate limiting.** Historical data reads retry transient errors. Failed registration results are retried and then rejected, never interpreted as inactive validators. Settlement uses historical stakes, so current registration cannot erase past earnings.
- **All-or-nothing proposer recovery.** If any single checkpoint can't be resolved to a proposer after retries, the run **stops with an error** — it won't hand you a skewed split. Re-run (or fix the RPC, lower the rate limit, etc.) and it'll be deterministic.
- **Reproducible amounts.** Fixed epoch bounds and unchanged payout policy produce the same recipients and integer amounts. Run IDs, timestamps and finalized snapshots can differ.
- The audit JSON records the rollup's reward config, the per-attester checkpoint counts, and the exact attestations, so a third party can re-verify the split independently.

                              compatible signer (Safe, other multisigs, smart
                              accounts). Optional <path>; defaults to next to
                              the audit JSON. The encoded transactions also
                              land in the audit JSON, so cold-wallet signers
                              can read them straight from there.
  --output-mode <mode>        (settle) `safe` = N top-level ERC20.transfer
                              calls (one per delegator); the Safe bundles them
                              via MultiSend. `disperse` = optional
                              ERC20.approve(Disperse, total) +
                              Disperse.disperseTokenSimple(token, recipients,
                              amounts) against disperse.app's contract. Safe
                              under a mempool race because Disperse calls
                              transferFrom(msg.sender, …) internally — only
                              the operator's own call can spend their
                              allowance. Defaults: `safe` with
                              --emit-calldata, `disperse` for live broadcast.
                              An earlier `multicall` mode (approve Multicall3
                              + aggregate3 of transferFrom) was removed after
                              a live drain incident; do not reintroduce.
  --ignore-coinbase           (settle) Count every operator checkpoint in the
                              window regardless of `header.coinbase`. Default
                              counts only checkpoints whose coinbase matches
                              `distributionWalletAddress` — the integrity gate
                              against mid-window switches. Requires
                              --simulate-reward; no real payout is emitted.
  --simulate-reward <amount>  (settle) Manual override of the reward amount.
                              The default is to compute the reward from the
                              checkpoint rewards plus net sequencer fees;
                              this flag pins a
                              hypothetical amount instead. Forces dry-run.
                              Required for attributionMode=equal-split
                              (which has no proposal count to multiply by).

Environment:
  PRIVATE_KEY     Required only when sending live (i.e. distribution wallet is
                  an EOA, not a Safe; rare). Safes use --emit-calldata.
  RUNNER_CONFIG   Default config path if --config not given.

The design alternatives that were considered alongside this approach (an on-chain treasury contract, and a full replacement of the StakingRegistry) live in a separate folder, [`../operator-margin-design-options/`](../operator-margin-design-options/) — not part of this repo.

## Testing

```bash
npm test            # 47 unit tests, no network access required
npm run typecheck   # strict TypeScript
```

The tests use a mock viem transport so they exercise the real discovery / proposal-counting / attribution / calldata paths end-to-end without ever hitting an RPC. A failing test means something's actually broken; a passing test means the math is what it claims to be.

## Status

The tool is feature-complete for the weekly settlement workflow and has been verified against a live archival RPC. Open items:

- **Discovery caching across runs.** Each run currently rescans the full registry history (~140 `eth_getLogs` chunks + ~200 stake-tx receipts ≈ 340 RPC calls every time). Persisting that between runs would cut subsequent runs by ~330 calls. Useful if you settle on a tight schedule and care about RPC budget.
- **Protocol compatibility.** Real payouts currently require verifiable v5 proposal fee headers and unchanged reward configuration within the window. Unsupported states stop with an error.

See [docs/runner-reference.md](./docs/runner-reference.md) for the deeper technical writeup.
